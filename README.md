just a bot im working on lol have fun i guess

if u wanna run it then make a new bot and get your token (do not share the token with anyone)

then copy main.py and run on visual studio or replit or something idfk

if you're running on replit make sure to make a new secret and name the key DISCORD_TOKEN and in value put your token

then click run and the bot should be running
